Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is a diagram building system where different diagram elements (e.g., Graph, Figure) are created using the Singleton + Factory + Builder design pattern. These elements are rendered in visual and textual formats and cloned using the Prototype pattern.

Design Highlights:
-----------------
- Utilizes Builder and Prototype design patterns to create and clone diagram elements.
- UML diagrams were used to model the system structure (created with PlantUML).
- The system includes a DiagramFactory for creating diagram elements and a PrototypeManager to register and clone them.

Code Refactoring:
-----------------
The code was refactored with the help of ChatGPT to improve readability and maintainability.
