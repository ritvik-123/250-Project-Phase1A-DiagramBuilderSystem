# Diagram Building System (Phase 1 using Builder, Factory, Singleton, and Prototype patterns)

This repository contains a **diagram building system** that demonstrates the use of multiple **object-oriented design patterns** to create, render, and clone diagram elements.

---

## Project Overview

The system allows different diagram elements (such as **Graph** and **Figure**) to be created using a combination of **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Builder** design patterns.  
Diagram elements can be rendered in both **visual** and **textual** formats and cloned using the **Prototype** pattern.

---

## Design Highlights

- Uses **Builder** and **Prototype** design patterns to create and clone diagram elements  
- Uses **Factory** and **Singleton** patterns for object creation and management  
- UML diagrams were used to model the system structure (created using **PlantUML**)  
- Includes a `DiagramFactory` for creating diagram elements  
- Includes a `PrototypeManager` for registering and cloning elements

## Code Refactoring

The code was refactored with the help of **ChatGPT** to improve readability and maintainability.
